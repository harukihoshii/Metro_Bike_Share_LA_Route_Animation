# Animating Metro Bike Share trip data

## Overview

Metro Bike Share in LA provides an open source [trip dataset](https://bikeshare.metro.net/about/data/). Using the longtitude and latitude of each trip's start and end points, the code uses `gganimate`to create animations that visualise potential journeys that users may have taken. The routes are computed using `orsm`.

## Outputs

Hereâ€™s an animation showing all the bike routes (shortest path) on **April 1st, 2025**:
